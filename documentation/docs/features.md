title: Overview

By the end of setup, you'll have a Next.js project and features which is specified at the below.

* **Next.js** - Minimalistic framework for server-rendered React applications.
* **Typescript** - Superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing, classes and interfaces. path support(allias)
* **Redux** - State management
* **Express.js**- Handles server-side rendering and integrated with Express.js
* **Built-in Project CLI**- Create pages, components, actions, reducers with one command by using built-in cli.
* **Sass/Scss** - CSS preprocessor, which adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS.
* **Babel** -  The compiler for next generation JavaScript. Module(alias) support 
* **TSLint** - Contains TypeScript-specific options for our project.
* **Reverse Proxy** - A reverse proxy server is a type of proxy server that typically sits behind the firewall in a private network and directs client requests to the appropriate backend server
* **Bundler Analyzer** - Visualize size of webpack output files with an interactive zoomable treemap.
* **dotenv .config** - Expose environment variables to the runtime config of Next.js
* **Jest** - Javascript testing framework , created by developers who created react
* **Enzyme** - JavaScript testing utility for React that makes it easier to test your React Components output.

*Here are a few highlights to look out for in this boilerplate*

<dl>
  
  <dd>The boilerplate includes tsconfig.json which contains a list of your input files as well as all your compilation settings.<dd>
  <br>

  >One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type-checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called “duck typing” or “structural subtyping”. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project.

 
  <dd>Includes babel-plugin-module-resolver <dd>
<br>

  >A Babel plugin to add a new resolver for your modules when compiling your code using Babel. This plugin allows you to add new "root" directories that contain your modules. It also allows you to setup a custom alias for directories, specific files, or even other npm modules.

  
  <dd>Includes next-runtime-dotenv <dd>
<br>

  >Normally, .env isn’t available in the browsers (only Node.js), but our boilerplate uses npm package for make it available.

  <dd>Includes jest and enzyme <dd>
<br>

  > Jest was created by Facebook and is a testing framework to test javascript and React code. Together with Airbnb’s Enzyme, which is a testing utility, makes it the perfect match to easily test your React application.
